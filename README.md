## Mentor
- **Shaik Hatim**

## Project Overview
CircuitSeer streamlines the task of circuit analysis by using advanced object detection techniques to identify and classify various circuit components. The model is trained to detect components like resistors and capacitors using YOLOv5 due to its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection.

## Features
- **Component Detection**: Automatically identifies and classifies circuit components.
- **Wire Detection**: Includes algorithms like Canny Edge Transform and Hough Transform for wire mapping.
- **Schematic Analysis**: Transforms physical circuit layouts into schematic diagrams for easier analysis.
- **Solving Circuits**: Provides step-by-step solutions for circuits in series or parallel arrangements.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv5**: For fast and accurate component detection.
- **Python**: Backend processing of circuit images.
- **Flask**: Server-side API handling requests between the front end and the AI model.
